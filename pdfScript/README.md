# PDF files manager
> Simple cli script that allow you to merge pdf files or insert pages to take notes.


I wrote this simple script in order to facilitate the process of merging pdf files and creating handouts with lines to take notes.

The handouts option simply insert, between each page of the pdf, one slide similar to the image below.

<img src="lines.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 10px;"/>


Then you have to print the pdf with 6 slide per page in order to obtain this result:

<img src="./print_sample.gif" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>
